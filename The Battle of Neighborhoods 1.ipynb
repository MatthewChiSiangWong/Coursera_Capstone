    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Living in a city is a dream for many. We grow up watching movies and series based on different cities that eventually form our perception of a \"dream life\" in a \"dream city\". For many, we start thinking \"when I grow up, I want to live in (insert city name) and become an (insert dream job)\" and, this is great. We start working towards our dreams, to live in London or New York or Melbourne or any other city. However, once we get the opportunity to live in this city, our main _question_ becomes: __WHERE?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take London as an example and consider the three following questions/factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which part of London do we stay in? <br>\n",
    "Do we stay in Central london? What if it's too expensive, wherelse is there? How about Camden?\n",
    "2. What do I need on a regular basis? <br>\n",
    "Is there a supermarket or train station nearby? __These will be our primary focus for this project__\n",
    "3. What attractions are there? <br>\n",
    "Is there a cafe in the area? Is the area lively at night?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without even considering the price variations across the city, we already have this problem. We can't really know what is around each location (unless we _manually_ look through Google Maps or Tripadvisor) and apart from asking other people or reading reviews online, not everyone knows a quick solution to this. Understanding what each area has or is known for can easily help the \"everyday person\" make a deicsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction explains the \"why\" and the following parts will explain the \"who\", \"what\" and \"how\"."

    "\n",
    "Location      | Justification \n",
    "--------------|---\n",
    "Supermarket   | Applicable to any type of demographic (i.e. families, working professionals, students, etc.)\n",
    "Train Station | Most people commute around the city through trains, it's could be the London Underground, Overground, DLR, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvios rebuttal question would be \"how about schools or other amenities?\" and that's a valid question. However, to make this applicable to most people, other criteria can't be included. Additionally, some people might not want to stay near restaurants or areas that are known for its night life.\n",

Subsequently, we will use the Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighborhoods. As we are interested in train stations and supermarkets, our clustering of the locations will be based on a dataset that contains/combines both categories."
